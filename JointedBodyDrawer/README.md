# Jointed Body Drawer
The Jointed Body Drawer is a Unity framework for drawing any object that has joints. Mostly the focus is toward NUI devices (Intel RealSense, Microsoft Kinect, Leap Motion, ect.), but it could work for any tracked object that has joints.

## Example
Included in this directory is the JointedBodyDrawerKinectDemo.unitypackage. It contains an example of how to use the Jointed Body Drawer with the Microsoft Kinect v2.  This example requires the Kinect Unity Package, which can be found [here](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/kinect/tools). After you have imported that package, simply import the JointedBodyDrawerKinectDemo.unitypackage, deploy the JointedBodyDrawerKinectDemo prefab into the scene, and run.
